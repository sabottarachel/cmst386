    <h4 class="questions">How do search engines work?</h4>
    <p>The most common type of search engines are crawler-based, meaning that it is an automated system that basically scans the web. This action is known as crawling. There are human-based search engines, which requires a person to manually read, review, and rank websites. There is also a Hybrid engine, which uses crawlers but then humans influence the overall ranking in a database. So, most people wonder what to include in your website to make it rank higher in a search engine. All search engines have a unique set of standards, but these standards are not public information. However, there are things you can implement to help increase your websites ranking.</p>

    <h4 class="questions">Explain the importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags</h4>
    <p>Keywords are the common words that a user would be searching for to find your website as a resource. They should be included in a clean URL and in the content itself. Keyword stuffing is frowned upon because it can be overwelming, and considered spam by some search engines. Not all search engines value meta keywords, and it is not considered valuable. Note that keywords are different from meta keywords. For example, Google search engines do not use the keyword meta tag, so it does not help increase ranking on this search engine. Meta description tags are a short description of the webpage content, and it typically appears underneath the webpage URL on the search engine. This is to draw readers into the site, and if the meta description is accurate, it will hopefully decrease user bounce rate. This will increase ranking. The meta description is for the users, and the search engine does not use keywords in this meta tag for ranking.</p>

    <h4 class="questions">List the four elements that comprise writing relevant content links</h4>
    <p>Links are one of the top factors when it comes to ranking your website on search engines. There are some things to keep in mind when creating links. One, the anchor text should be relevant, and if a lot of links are pointing to a page, it will be marked as important. Two, make sure your links are based on your content, and not something irrelevant. Third, make sure to avoid spammy behavior because a search engine may flag it and not rank the site. Last, make sure that you are linking to relevant content, and it may boost your likelihood of getting linked and noticed elsewhere.</p>

    <h4 class="questions">What constitutes good heading hierarchy? Include an example with more than one heading tag.</h4>
    <p>HTML offers six different heading tags, which include H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6. H1 is the largest heading tag, and should be used at the top of the webpage. Then, the hierarchy goes from largest to smallest. There are a few reasons this is important. When looking at the overall style of the webpage, it would look strange if the page title was small but a subheader for an article was large. Another reason headings are important is because it allows users to skim the webpage to locate a specific section. Search engines also crawl headings to understand the purpose of the webpage and its content. Below, I've included an example of the hierarchy.</p>

    <h1>Header 1</h1>
    <h2>Header 2</h2>
    <h3>Header 3</h3>
    <h4>Header 4</h4>
    <h5>Header 5</h5>
    <h6>Header 6</h6>
